			<p>The css for body's font-family has an opening quotation mark but no end quotation mark. The margin-left is not able to be processed as the quotation is never ended. The css style marginleft for headers does not have a dash between the two words. This is an incorrect way of using margin-left.</p>

				The website will contain a placeholder for an image of the class/professor using the <span class="unique"> img tag</span> at the very top of the page with their name or class name under it using a <span class="unique">h1-h6 header</span>. The <span class="unique">table</span> will be used to provide the students with a schedule of how the classwork will be distributed and around what time along with any links to assignments that will be posted later in the semester using the <span class="unique">a tag</span>. The <span class="unique">link tag</span> will be used to incorporate an external css file into the website so that there will be a foundation for all of the webpages. The <span class="unique">style tag</span> will be used for each professor to decorate their website in a unique way. The <span class="unique">ol and ul tags</span> will list out the grade percentages for each part of the class as well as the class rules that students need to follow. The <span class="unique">title tag</span> allows for students to easily figure out which tab they need to click for which website by having the teachers/class name as the title. Each professor can use the <span class="unique">p tag</span> to introduce the class or themselves as well as provide any information they desire about the class. Using these tags each professor will be able to follow a foundational structure for the school while also allowing each professor to uniquely decorate their website. Since each website will be based off a certain style, the students will not have to spend minutes looking around the website to figure out where everything is located.
