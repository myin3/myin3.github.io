Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little control over the way that a page is displayed.  It should be remembered that HTML was developed as a means of marking  up  the  structure  of  a  document  not  as  a  way  of  determining  its  presentation. Formatting text to appear on a Web page is therefore different from formatting text to appear in a printed document.

This
